## 🌍 Augmenting Human Intelligence

In an era where information is abundant but often siloed by language, **Babel** stands as a bridge. We believe that knowledge should be universally accessible, regardless of the language it was originally written in.

Babel is a powerful **document translation tool** that combines **Agentic OCR** with cutting-edge **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to deliver highly accurate translations. Unlike conventional translation services, Babel preserves the original formatting, layout, and structure of your documents—ensuring that complex PDFs with tables, charts, headers, and multi-column layouts are translated seamlessly.

By leveraging state-of-the-art Generative AI and intelligent optical character recognition, we empower individuals to tap into vast knowledge reservoirs that were previously out of reach. Whether it's technical documentation, literary masterpieces, or academic research, Babel ensures that language is no longer a barrier to understanding.

## 🚀 Mission

Our mission is to democratize access to global knowledge. We are building a future where:
- **Language is fluid**: Ideas flow freely across linguistic borders.
- **Knowledge is universal**: Every human has the right and ability to learn from the collective wisdom of the world.
- **Potential is unleashed**: By removing language constraints, we unlock the full creative and intellectual potential of humanity.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Partners

Babel is the result of a visionary collaboration led by **LunarTech**. We have partnered with industry leaders to build a robust, scalable, and intelligent system.

- **Multi-Format Support**: Seamlessly handles PDF, DOCX, and other major document formats.
- **Powered by LLMs**: Utilizes the latest advancements in Large Language Models for unmatched accuracy.
- **Broad Language Support**: Supports translation across 50+ major languages.

## 🌐 Supported Languages

Babel currently supports high-quality translation for over 50 languages:

## 🔄 How It Works

Babel streamlines the translation process into a simple, intuitive flow:

1.  **Upload**: Drag and drop your document (PDF, DOCX) into the Babel dashboard.
2.  **Select Language**: Choose your desired target language from our supported list.
3.  **Translate**: Our AI engine analyzes the document structure, extracts text, and translates it while preserving context and formatting.
4.  **Download**: Receive your perfectly translated document, ready for immediate use.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Babel is built on a modern, decoupled architecture designed for performance and scalability.

### Component Interaction
1.  **Frontend (Dashboard)**: A responsive web interface built with HTML/CSS/JS that handles file uploads and status polling.
2.  **Backend (FastAPI)**: A high-performance Python server that manages jobs, handles file I/O, and orchestrates the translation process.
3.  **BabelDOC Engine**: The core intelligence layer that processes documents. It runs as a subprocess to ensure isolation and stability.

## 🧠 Under the Hood: BabelDOC

BabelDOC is the engine that powers our high-fidelity translations. Unlike standard translation tools that treat text as a flat string, BabelDOC understands **document structure**.

### The Pipeline
1.  **Layout Analysis**: BabelDOC first analyzes the PDF layout to understand headers, footers, columns, and images.
2.  **Term Extraction**: Before translating, it extracts key terminology to ensure consistency across the entire document.
3.  **Contextual Translation**: Text is grouped into logical blocks (paragraphs) and sent to the LLM (GPT-4o) with context, ensuring that "bank" is translated correctly whether it refers to a river or money.
4.  **Reconstruction**: The translated text is injected back into the original layout, preserving fonts, styles, and positioning.

## 🛠️ Technical Setup

To run the Babel server locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- OpenAI API Key

### Installation & Startup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd babel-backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart openai
    ```

3.  **Set your API Key**:
    ```bash
    # Windows (PowerShell)
    $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    
    # Mac/Linux
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

4.  **Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

### Explanation of "Tongues of Flame" Upgrade:
- **Image Extraction and Reinsertion**: Added `extract_images_and_positions` to identify embedded images and their positions using `pymupdf`. Added `reinsert_images` to re-add them to the translated PDF at the exact positions.
- **Bold Text Detection**: Added `check_and_preserve_bold_text` to scan the PDF for bold text (by checking font names and flags). It logs detection but relies on BabelDOC to preserve formatting in the translation output, as direct manipulation of BabelDOC's internal process is moved to server.py.
- **Integration in `translate_file`**: Preprocessing now extracts images and checks for bold text before running BabelDOC. Postprocessing reinserts images after translation and before watermarking.

### Benefits and Considerations
- **Bold Text Detection**: Logs bold text for awareness. BabelDOC typically preserves font styles, so this is more for monitoring. If needed, you could add custom logic to force bold in the output, but that's complex and may not be necessary.
- **Image Extraction/Reinsertion**: Ensures images are preserved accurately, as BabelDOC might alter PDF structure during translation. This is especially useful for documents with diagrams or logos.
- **Performance**: These steps add minimal overhead (pymupdf is fast), and they run in the background thread without blocking the API.
- **Error Handling**: Wrapped in try-except to avoid crashing the job if pymupdf fails (e.g., if the PDF is corrupted).
- **Testing**: Test with sample PDFs containing images and bold text. Ensure BabelDOC's output directory (`OUTPUTS_DIR`) is accessible.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `pymupdf` is installed (add to requirements if needed).


These additions ensure images are preserved and bold text is detected, with preservation handled by the translation tool
