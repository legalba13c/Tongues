# Babel Translation - User Guide & Troubleshooting

## ✅ Good News!
Your translation **IS working**! The backend received your file and started translating it. The issue is that PDF translation takes time (usually 3-10 minutes for a research paper).

## What's Happening Right Now

Based on the backend logs, I can see:
- ✅ File uploaded successfully: `2405.15033v3.pdf`
- ✅ Target language selected: German (de)
- ✅ BabelDOC is currently processing your translation
- ⏳ Translation in progress...

## How to Use the System

### Step 1: Make Sure Backend is Running
```bash
cd /Users/lunartech/Documents/Apps/Babel/Babel-backend-antigravity
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
python3 server.py
```

### Step 2: Open Dashboard
Visit: `http://localhost:8000`

### Step 3: Upload and Translate
1. Click "Upload New Document" or go directly to the upload page
2. Select your PDF/DOCX file
3. Choose target language
4. Click "Translate Handbook"
5. **WAIT!** Translation can take 3-10 minutes for large PDFs

### Step 4: Check for Translated File
While waiting, you can manually check:
```bash
cd /Users/lunartech/Documents/Apps/Babel/Babel-backend-antigravity/Outputs
ls -lt  # Shows newest files first
```

## Translation Times

| File Size | Estimated Time |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1-5 pages | 1-3 minutes |
| 5-20 pages | 3-7 minutes |
| 20+ pages | 7-15 minutes |

## Debug Tips

### Check Browser Console
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Click "Console" tab
3. Look for error messages or logs starting with "Starting translation..."

### Check Backend Logs
Look at the terminal where `python3 server.py` is running. You should see:
```
File saved to: .../Inputs/yourfile.pdf
Target language: de
Running command: uv run babeldoc ...
```

### Common Issues

**"Network error"**
- Backend server isn't running
- Wrong port (should be 8000)
- Solution: Restart server with `python3 server.py`

**"Translation taking too long"**
- This is normal for large PDFs!
- BabelDOC is working in the background
- Check the Outputs folder manually while waiting

**"OPENAI_API_KEY not set"**
- You forgot to export the API key
- Solution: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"`

## Current Status

Based on the backend logs from just now:
- ✅ Server is running on port 8000
- ✅ File `2405.15033v3.pdf` was uploaded
- ✅ BabelDOC command started successfully
- ⏳ Translation to German is in progress...

**The translation should complete in about 5-10 minutes.** Check the Outputs folder!

## What I Just Fixed

I added better error handling and logging to the upload page:
- ✅ Console logs show translation progress
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Network error detection
- ✅ Timeout warnings

**Refresh the page (`localhost:8000`) to get the updated code with better debugging.**
